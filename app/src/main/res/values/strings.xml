    <string name="sample_para">An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides essential services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling tasks like running applications, managing files, and handling input/output operations. Common examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. The OS ensures that different programs and users running on a computer do not interfere with each other, making it crucial for efficient and secure system operation.</string>
